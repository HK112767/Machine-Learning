# Machine Learning Algorithms
This portfolio consists of Jupyter notebooks where I have explored and implemented different supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The models were trained using built-in datasets from scikit-learn, and various preprocessing techniques were applied before training.

# Algorithms
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Linear Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Means Clustering

# Overview of each notebook
Dataset Loading - Built-in datasets from sklearn.datasets
Data Preprocessing - Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables
Model Training - Training the models using sklearn's machine learning algorithms
Performance Evaluation - Using metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
Analysis & Insights - Understanding model behavior and improvements
